CrossCompute Types
==================
Use these data types to build computational apps using the CrossCompute framework.

- `integer <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-integer>`_
- `text <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-text>`_
- `table <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-table>`_
- `select <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-select>`_
- `image <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-image>`_
- `audio <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-audio>`_
- `video <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-video>`_
- `geotable <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-geotable>`_


Install
-------
Run the following command inside your virtual environment for basic functionality. ::

    pip install -U crosscompute-types

Installing additional packages will enable additional features.

- matplotlib
- gdal
- shapely
- geotable

For convenience, you can install the full set using `these Ansible scripts <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-environments-ansible>`_.
