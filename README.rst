Use these data types to build computational apps using the CrossCompute framework.

- `integer <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-integer>`_
- `text <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-text>`_
- `select <https://github.com/salah93/crosscompute-select>`_
- `image <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-image>`_
- `table <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-table>`_
- `geotable <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-geotable>`_


Install
-------
Run the following command inside your virtual environment for basic functionality. ::

    pip install -U crosscompute-types

Installing additional packages will enable additional features. 

- geotable
    - matplotlib
    - gdal
    - shapely
    - geometryIO

For convenience, you can install the full set using `these Ansible scripts <https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-environments-ansible>`_.
